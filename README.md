# 3D-Controller-and-Trajectory-Generation
MATLAB Programming Exercise 3
# 1 Introduction
In this exercise, I will be extending PD controller to control a quadrotor in 3D. I will then generate the time parameterized trajectories such that the quadrotor will navigate through all of the given waypoints.

# 2 System Model
